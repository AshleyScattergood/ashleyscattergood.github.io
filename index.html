  <h1>The Making of Me</h1><div class="project-wrapper"><p class="project">My fabric heart book was created for the 2016 &lsquo;We Love Your Books&rsquo; submission of dot & dash. The book is made entirely of fabric, images created in acrylic were manipulated to form new images that are directly linked to songs that pinpoint specific moments in my life. The book is encased in a fabric heart that is a patchwork of parts of images within the book.</p>
  <p class="project">The Making of Me is an interactive book that was made to accompany the fabric heart book. Each page is a description of the memory associated with the first book, with a different image. The book is interactive and comes with an extra book that details the methods used to make the original fabric book.</p>

  <h1>Starpack</h1><div class="project-wrapper"><p class="project">Wrap-pack was designed in response to the 2017 Student Starpack competition, where the DS Smith brief a redesign of secure transit packaging that could be adapted in size for different items, utilising the properties and flexibility of corrugated card. The final design provides impact protection for any items stored inside through its honeycomb structure. Additional protection is provided by internal flaps, which assure against movement as well as safeguard against external factors such as weather.</p>
    <p class="project">Wrap-pack connects together in one smooth motion and is further secured with the address label section. The packaging is fully recyclable and can be flat-packed before purchase or for storage between uses. Visually Wrap- pack is unique whilst retaining its functionality. The design could be modified in production to include branding, internal branding patterns, general patterns, colour or a change in shape.</p>

	<h1>The Journey</h1><div class="project-wrapper">
    <p class="project">The Journey was created in answer to the need for recognition of parents that have received a disability diagnosis for their child. After conducting a survey amongst parents it became very clear that many felt that they received very little advice or support either in their role or at the stage of diagnosis. With this in mind I created a starter kit, similar to those received by new parents.</p>
    <p class="project">The kit is designed to help introduce parents to the realities of the role, whilst offering advice and practical support. It also offers reassurance that they are not alone and that there is a whole community out there waiting to welcome them, as many parents taking part in the survey also disclosed that they felt isolated and others less so because they had found support from other parents in a similar situation.</p>
